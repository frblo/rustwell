//! Traits for exporting [`Screenplay`]s
//!
//! This module defines the [`Exporter`] trait, which can be implented to provide
//! custom export methods. The [`Exporter`] trait is designed to be dyn-compatible
//! to allow end-application to implement dynamic pickers of exporters.
//!
//! # Implementing
//! [`Exporter::export`] returns [`std::io::Result`] and is generally expected
//! to only return Error when there is an issue with the writer.

/// A [`Screenplay`] exporter.
///
/// Types Implementing this trait provide logic for exporting a [`Screenplay`]
/// to some format.
pub trait Exporter {
    /// Returns the file extension for this exporter's output format,
    /// e.g. `"html"`.

/// An extension trait for [`Exporter`] providing common functionality.
///
/// There is a blanket implementation so any type implementing [`Exporter`] also
/// implements this trait, including `dyn Exporter`.
///
/// # Usage
/// This trait must be in scope to use its methods:
/// ```
/// use rustwell::ExporterExt;
/// ```

    /// Exports the screenplay to stdout.

# Rustwell

Like *Fountain*, but written in *Rust* and it works *well*.

Rustwell is a library for creating formatted screen- and stageplays, based on [Fountain](https://fountain.io/). The crate introduces both a Fountain parser, but also the intermediary AST and a few ways of exporting different kinds of documents.

## Usage

Add this dependency to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
rustwell = "0.1.0"
```

and then start using the library. Please read the documentation for more details on how to use the library.
